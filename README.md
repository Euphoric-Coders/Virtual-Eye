A virtual assistant for the visually impaired.

# Requirements(Modules/Dependancies):
1. Tensorflow
2. OpenCV-python
3. Numpy
4. Pandas
5. SpeechRecognition
6. Pyttsx3
7. Keras
8. H5py
9. Scipy
10. Cython
11. Sklearn
12. Matplotlib
13. Pygame
14. Socket 
15. Pillow
16. Dataset: Link to download: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vbAEa-md9fQah2mNsv5df7MP_rM_mM-j/view?usp=sharing

# Instructions to run:
1. pip install all the above modules(refer to the internet for more information).
2. For the dataset, open the google drive link and download the .h5 file.
3. Move this .h5 file to the directory "Server/Subfiles", of the GitHub download.
4. Run the "Main_Server.py" file in the "Server" folder first
5. Once the IDE says "Waiting for Connection...", run the "gui.py" file from the "Client" folder.
6. If one wants to split the load to 2 computers, one can run the same two files in two different computers in the same manner as described above, provided that the entire folders are stored in the respective computers(Server into server and client into the client).
7. Now, your Virtual-Eye is up and running!
